Open Coding Labs, Spring 2015
=============================

If you’ve ever wanted to expand your tool belt of languages beyond STATA and SAS, and if you've ever wanted to do this at your own pace, then these sessions are for you.

Head on over to the [Open Coding Labs Wiki](https://github.com/public-health-data-scientists/open-coding-labs/wiki) to get started!

Objectives
----------
Our goal is to build a community in the MPH program and greater CUMC student body centered around coding and data science. We want to provide support and guidance to make coding less intimidating and more approachable for MPH'ers.

Logistics
----------
- Tuesdays from 11.30am - 1.30pm
- The first session is on Tuesday, March 10th
- Coffee and snacks will be served
- Location TBD

Details
----------
The Open Coding Labs are meant to be a series of informal sessions where MPH students can learn how to apply coding to their public health interests. Members of the Public Health Data Scientists will provide resources and guidance to help students get started on their coding journey’s, in addition to offering support to students who have coding experience and would like to build on their current knowledge. 

We will mostly be providing support for learning and applying R programming, one of the emerging open source statistical programming languages in the market today. 

Tracks
----------
- Beginner - if you don't know what `variable assignment` and `if-else statements` are.
- Intermediate - if you are curious what `function definition` and `for/while loops` are.
